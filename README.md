### INTERNSHIP TASK: 

PROBLEM STATEMENT- *We have to predict the percentage of marks that student is expected to score based upon the number of hours of studying.*

In our dataset we have two columns- 

a) Hours (no. of hours the student studies) : *Independent Variable*

b) Scores (percentages of marks the student will score) : *Dependent Variable*

In this project I had used the Simple Linear Regression, since our data has linear relationship with each other

Using this model, I am getting-

*Mean Absolute Error* :  4.183859899002975

*Mean Squared Error* :  21.5987693072174

*Root Mean Squared Error* :  4.6474476121003665
